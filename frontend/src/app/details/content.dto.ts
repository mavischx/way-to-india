The steep valleys last for the first 3 km. of the trek and again come towards the last 3 km. If you are not able to cope up with the trek, then you can take a pony or a helicopter. Ponies cost around Rs. 800 to Rs. 2,000. Helicopters are available only during clear weather. The best time to undertake the Valley of Flowers trek is June to September. Palanquins are also available for elderly people at a higher cost. On the way, you come across Pulma and Bhyuandar, both of which were heavily damaged during the 2013 floods but are now rehabilitated.",
